# Contributing

Your contributions are always welcome!

## Guideline

* Add one link per Pull Request.
    * Make sure the PR title is in the format of `Add model-name`.
    * Make sure that you are adding a model that is published in a scientific journal or as a pre-print.
* There are six types of links:
    * thesis: link directly to the document.
    * publication: always link to the doi.
    * pre-print: always link to the doi.
    * web server: the web server of the model.
    * standalone software: a standalone version of the model.
    * repository: the code necessary to run or train the model. Right now we have three types of repositories:
        * repository
        * repository: training of the model
        * repository: R package
* Make sure that you are adding the model to the proper section.
* Search previous Pull Requests or Issues before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Remove any trailing whitespace.
